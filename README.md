The purpose of this project (description):

Hello! My name is Seth and I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate student attending Toronto Metropolitan University (currently First
Year on Winter Break). I created this project as a way for myself to convert images that I encouter into .png images with transparent backgrounds.
I am a huge video game player, and often enjoy playing with friends. When I play games, I take lots of screenshots, and sometimes I need these
screenshots to have a transparent background. Simple solution to a simple problem, right? Just go on Google and use any of the online tools 
available. Well, no. Most of the websites I encounter are either ad-infested, require an account, contain potential malware, keep your uploaded files,
abuse cookies, disable functionality due to an adblocker,... the list goes on. I made this project to avoid all of these issues. Creating this project
has proven to come with its various perks as well. This project gave me practice using Python and Git Bash (I hate command prompt), allowed me
to integrate the features that mattered most to me, and most importantly, gave me something to keep me busy. I will continue to update this
project according to my personal needs, as well as use it as a regular part of my screen-capturing day.

I hope you are able to find convenience in this tool like I did. Enjoy!
